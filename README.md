### Project Description -
Our app is a music exploration platform inspired by Spotify that allows users to display their respective playlists, and 
then sort through each playlist by alphabetical order (A-Z), name of the artist, name of the album, year, length, 
popularity, and lastly, a default setting that resets the user's playlist to its default configuration. 
Additionally, the user is able to click on the song itself, which takes the user to the Song Details page, where details about the song, 
such as name of the artist, album name, and release year, are displayed. Not only that, but the user is able to click the Play button next 
to "Listen", which opens up the song on Spotify.
